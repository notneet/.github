YaHallo~

## Ideas to be realized:

<details>
<summary>Nime Crawler</summary>

In this project, the final result that I want to achieve is, I can bring all web streaming into one place. The benefit is, I don't have to bother looking for various websites. Of course, I will use microservice architecture

For the storage itself, I'd use:
- MySQL
- MongoDB / Apache Solr
- Object Storage

Then, the technology that I will use:
- NestJS as BackEnd -- [nime-crawler](https://github.com/notneet/nime-crawler)
- NextJS as FrontEnd -- undefined

Then in the future maybe I will expand it to Telegram Bot or I will make an API client
